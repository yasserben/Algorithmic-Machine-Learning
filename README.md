# Algorithmic-Machine-Learning

These notebooks were carried out during the Alogirthmic Machine Learning class, during my last year of engineering school at EURECOM.

I worked on these subjects in pairs with Cocogeek (Github Link : https://github.com/Cocogeek)

The notebooks are organized as follows :

1. Music Recommender System : a large-scale recommender system using ALS algorithm
2. House pricing prediction : predicting house prices using the ElasticNet, Lasso and Ridge algorithms (Kaggle      Challenge)
3. Plankton Classification : Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform plankton image classification
4. Anomaly Detection : Development of multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic regression,Random Forest, Scalable Bayesian Rule Lists ) to perform anomaly detection and classification
